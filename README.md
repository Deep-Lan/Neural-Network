# Neural-Network
neural network and BP algorithm

"experiment report.pdf" is experiment report,and you can regrad it as instruction. "neuralnetwork.py" is python script. "data.txt" is the Iris Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Note:All the dataset file and python script need to be taken in the same subdirectory.If you want to run it, you should run it in python3.And modules "random" "matplotlib" and "numpy" are necessary.Otherwise,you could get back errors.
